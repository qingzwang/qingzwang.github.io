Dr. Qingzhong Wang now is a researcher in Baidu research. His research interests include **image captioning**, **vision & language** and **multimodality**. He received the Ph.D degree from [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/) in 2021 supervised by [Prof. Antoni Chan](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~abchan/). He received the M.Eng and B.Eng from [Harbin Engineering University](http://www.hrbeu.edu.cn/) in 2016 and 2013, respectively.
